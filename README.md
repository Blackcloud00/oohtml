> An HTML-based, UI design system thatâ€™s as simple and universal as HTML Itself!

CHTML is a pure HTML-based, **UI functional design system** that lets you build your UI from smaller html components and have everything work as one wonderful piece of craftsmanship. This is a fundamental shift that finally brings UI development from the **engineering** realm of JavaScript back to the **design** field of HTML (the original markup language for the web)!

Build elegant user interfaces without learning a template syntax or a build tool! Share your html-based components around and use them anywhere HTML works and forget about a compile step or a dependency! This is the luxury of an HTML-based design system! CHTML empowers the design side of you and enriches your overall design experience by *minimizing your engagement with JavaScript* on the UI; all that engineering should really be the concern of the application layer.
